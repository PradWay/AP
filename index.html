                <p class="intro">
                    It's been 2 months since December 26th when you became mine. Every moment with you has been absolutely magical.

                    <p>
                        I love how beautiful you are—not just your appearance, but your entire presence. 
                        Your laugh, your kindness, the way you light up any room... everything about you makes me smile.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I love the time we spend together. Late-night conversations, silly moments, comfortable silences, 
                        and even you looking absolutely adorable in my oversized jacket! 😄
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You've brought so much joy and happiness into my life. Every day feels special when you're around.
                    </p>
